    "# Web scraping: THE WORLD FACTBOOK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducción\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The World Factbook\" de la CIA es una publicación en línea que proporciona información detallada sobre diversos países y territorios de todo el mundo. Es una referencia ampliamente utilizada y una de las fuentes de información más completas y confiables sobre datos demográficos, geográficos, económicos, políticos y militares de diferentes naciones.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "La página web de \"The World Factbook\" de la CIA ofrece un amplio conjunto de datos sobre más de 250 países y territorios (262 para el 14 de junio del 2023). Proporciona información sobre aspectos como la geografía, la población, el gobierno, la economía, las comunicaciones, las fuerzas militares y mucho más. Estos datos incluyen descripciones, estadísticas, gráficos y mapas que permiten obtener una visión general de cada país o territorio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objetivos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generales\n",
    "- Recopilar datos desde una página web por medio de métodos de programación tradicional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Especifícos\n",
    "- Analizar la estructura del contenidos de la página web `The World Factbook`. \n",
    "- Extraer datos mediante el uso de técnicas de web scrapping utilizando el lenguaje de programación Python.\n",
    "- Modelar y diseñar la base de datos que almacenará los datos sustraidos de la página web `The World factbook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descripción del problema\n",
    "El objetivo de este proyecto es realizar un proceso de Web Scraping en la página web \"[The World factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/)\" para extraer datos relevantes sobre diversos países. Utilizando el lenguaje de programación Python y la biblioteca BeautifulSoup, se llevará a cabo la extracción y procesamiento de la información disponible en la página web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Una vez obtenidos los datos, se almacenarán en un archivo plano en formato JSON, lo cual permitirá su posterior manipulación y análisis. El siguiente paso consistirá en realizar un proceso de ETL (Extracción, Transformación y Carga) para transferir los datos extraídos desde el archivo JSON a una base de datos relacional.\n",
    "\n",
    "La base de datos relacional será utilizada como fuente de información para responder a las preguntas planteadas en el contexto del proyecto. Mediante consultas a la base de datos, se podrán obtener estadísticas, características y visualizaciones relevantes sobre los países y sus atributos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este proyecto tiene como finalidad demostrar las habilidades en Web Scraping, procesamiento de datos y manejo de bases de datos relacionales. Además, proporcionará una oportunidad para aplicar técnicas de visualización de datos y responder preguntas analíticas a partir de la información recopilada.\n",
    "\n",
    "A través de este proyecto, se espera que los participantes adquieran experiencia práctica en la obtención de datos, manipulación de información, modelado de datos y generación de conocimiento a partir de los mismos.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. - Actividades \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploración del sitio web [The World factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/)**\n",
    "    - Análisis inicial: Revisar, leer y explorar el sitio web.\n",
    "    - Revisar, leer y explorar la estructura `HTML` del sitio web.\n",
    "    - Reconocer diferentes etiquetas de contenido.\n",
    "    -  **Análisis**: Es necesario estudiar la estructura del `HTML` para la pagina web `The world factbook`, esta estructura es una pauta _inicial-esencial_ para la identificación de las etiquetas  que contienen caracteristicas de interes. Por ejemplo:\n",
    "       - titulos contenidos en etiquetas `<h2></h2>`\n",
    "       - subtitulos contenidos en etiquetas `<h3></h3>`\n",
    "       - parrafos contenidos en etiquetas `<p></p>`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extracción de los datos**\n",
    "    - Haciendo uso de la herramienta `Jupyter Notebook` programar los módulos necesarios que responden a la necesidad de extraer el contenido de la página web.\n",
    "    - Extraer de la página web los datos identificados a partir del lenguaje de programación Python utilizando la `librería BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "    - Extraer la información de cada uno de los países (historia, población, gobierno, economía, geografía, medio ambiente, comunicaciones, transporte...).\n",
    "    - Mediante el uso de python, hacer un pre procesamiento de los datos (extracción y limpieza, es decir obtener el texto plano sin etiquetas HTML, sin espacios en blanco).\n",
    "    - Guardar los datos para cada país en un archivo (único) plano en formato JSON.\n",
    "        - Respetando la estructura `clave:valor` del archivo con formato JSON\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **SQL**\n",
    "    - Crear un modelo `entidad relación` que responda a las preguntas de negocio (*leer detenidamente el inciso 5*).\n",
    "        - Crear la entidad.\n",
    "        - Identificar atributos.\n",
    "    - Esquematizar la base de datos, pasar del modelo `Entidad relación` al `lenguaje de definición de datos` (DDL).\n",
    "    - Crear una base de datos en MySQL con el nombre `IIDDBDWorldFactbook`.\n",
    "    - Crear una tabla en la base de datos `IIDDBDWorldFactbook` con el nombre `WorldFactbookDataAnalysis` con sus correspondientes campos, tipos de datos, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Nota**:\n",
    "Será importante identificar los campos que respondan a las preguntas exploratorias del inciso 5. Estos campos se refieren a los datos estructurados contenidos en el archivo plano en formato JSON. <br>\n",
    "Por ejemplo, `¿Cuáles son los países más y menos poblados?` quiere decir que existirá un atributo en la tabla `WorldFactbookDataAnalysis` llamado `population` que contiene el número total de población correspondiente a cada país. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **ETL**\n",
    "    - Mediante el uso de la herramienta de integración de datos, Talend, realizar un ETL (Extracción, Transformación y Carga) al archivo plano en formato JSON que contiene la información de los países.\n",
    "    - Mapear los datos (keys) del archivo plano en formato JSON con los campos de la tabla `WorldFactbookDataAnalysis`. \n",
    "    - Entregar un único archivo que es un JOB con los componentes que realicen lo pedido. \n",
    "    - Debe entregar una captura de pantalla con el JOB que contiene los componentes (una única imagen) con el nombre `etl.png`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",

The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN LADIN. A UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and was reelected in August 2009. The Taliban conducted an insurgency for two decades against the Afghan Government and international forces from the United States and other countries. In February 2020, the US and the Taliban signed an agreement that led to the withdrawal from Afghanistan of international forces in exchange for commitments on counterterrorism and other assurances. The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan on 15 August 2021.Â\"\n",
