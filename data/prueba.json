{"Introduction": {"Background": "Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology."}, "Geography": {"Location": "North America, bordering both the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean, between Canada and Mexico", "Geographic coordinates": "38 00 N, 97 00 W", "Map references": "North America", "Area": {"total:": "9,833,517 sq km", "land:": "9,147,593 sq km", "water:": "685,924 sq km", "note:": "includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia, no overseas territories"}, "Area - comparative": "about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa; about half the size of South America (or slightly larger than Brazil); slightly larger than China; more than twice the size of the European Union", "Land boundaries": {"total:": "12,002 km", "border countries (2):": "Canada 8,891 km (including 2,475 km with Alaska); Mexico 3,111 km", "note:": "US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is leased by the US and is part of Cuba; the base boundary is 28.5 km"}, "Coastline": "19,924 km", "Maritime claims": {"territorial sea:": "12 nm", "contiguous zone:": "24 nm", "exclusive economic zone:": "200 nm", "continental shelf:": "not specified"}, "Climate": {"note:": "many consider Denali, the highest peak in the US, to be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coldest mountain because of its combination of high elevation and its subarctic location at 63 degrees north latitude; permanent snow and ice cover over 75 percent of the mountain, and enormous glaciers, up to 45 miles long and 3,700 feet thick, spider out from its base in every direction; it is home to some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coldest and most violent weather, where winds of over 150 miles per hour and temperatures of -93\u00cb\u009aF have been recorded. \u00c2"}, "Terrain": "vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in east; rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged, volcanic topography in Hawaii", "Elevation": {"highest point:": "Denali 6,190 m (Mount McKinley) (highest point in North America)", "lowest point:": "Death Valley (lowest point in North America) -86 m", "mean elevation:": "760 m", "note: ": "Denali is one of the most striking features on the entire planet; at 20,310 feet, it is the crowning peak of the Alaska Range and the highest mountain on North America; it towers three and one-half vertical miles above its base, making it a mile taller from base to summit than Mt.
